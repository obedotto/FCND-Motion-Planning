## Project: 3D Motion Planning
In this project,I have developed an algorithm for 3D motion planning. To perform the motion planning, the destination location is given in GPS coordinates. The motion planning algorithm estimates the waypoints using A* algorithm, optimizes it, and then executes the plan to make the drone reach the destination location.

The following section explains the various steps I followed to develop this algorithm.
